# PATH

## Inspiration
Our team created PATH, short for Planned Assignment Timeline Helper, to aid and encourage students to keep track of their assignments, quizzes, and exams and assist them in completing these tasks on time.

## What it does
This timeline tool utilizes a unique way of displaying these events to inform the student of what's coming up, how long it will take, and what other events they need to prepare for.

## How we built it
We divided our work between frontend and backend so that we could work on both simultaneously. Those who worked on frontend and backend occasionally collaborated with one another, and overall all members assisted one another with development at some point.

## Challenges we ran into
Becoming acquainted with new languages and databases within the limited timeframe for development.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Completing and submitting the project on time, as well as successfully implementing a google database and solving difficult algorithms.

## What we learned
How to work with databases and aspects of languages including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## What's next for PATH: Planned Assignment Timeline Helper
Implementation of a function to share generated timelines with others using Google Cloud, and improving functionality as a whole.
